## Step 1. Use Ionic-MFP-App as a starting point for this project

This project builds on top of the app built in https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App. In this code pattern, we will enhance the 
app with following user authentication mechanisms:
* Enterprise login by connecting to on-premise LDAP server using Secure Gateway.
* Social login: Google login and Facebook login.

Copy Ionic Mobile app and Mobile Foundation adapters from parent repo as per instructions in 
http://bit-traveler.blogspot.in/2012/08/git-copy-file-or-directory-from-one.html as shown below.

* Create your repo on [Github.com](https://github.com) and add `README.md` file. Clone your new repo.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-new-repo-name>.git
```

* Make a git format-patch for the entire history of the subdirectories that we want as shown below.

```
$ mkdir gitpatches
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App.git
$ cd Ionic-MFP-App
$ git format-patch -o ../gitpatches/ --root IonicMobileApp/ MobileFoundationAdapters/
```

* Import the patches into your new repository as shown below.

```
$ cd ../<your-new-repo-name>
$ git am ../gitpatches/*
$ git push
```
